# Unit Testing for Python Developers

This repository contains examples of basic unit testing techniques for Python developers using the `unittest` library. The techniques covered include:

- Testing a function's output against a known expected result using the `assert` statement
- Using a testing library such as `unittest` or `pytest` to structure and run tests
- Testing for specific exceptions using `assertRaises` or context management
- Testing for correct handling of invalid input or edge cases
- Using mock objects to isolate the unit under test from external dependencies
- Testing for correct handling of different types and formats of input
- Testing a class's methods separately and in combination
- Testing for correct behavior when a method is called multiple times or with different input
- Testing for proper handling of properties and attributes
- Testing for consistency of output or state over a series of function calls or method invocations

The repository contains code examples for each of these techniques, as well as a simple `Calculator` class that can be used to test the above examples.

Please note that the examples provided are for illustration purposes only and may require modification to fit your specific use case. Additionally, this is a basic example and the methods of the class may not be suitable for real-world use.

## Getting Started

To run the examples, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can run the unit tests by executing the following command in your terminal:

python -m unittest discover


This command will run all the tests in the repository and display the results in the terminal.
